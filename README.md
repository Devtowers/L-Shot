• Lé shot

⇢ A simple interactive branching story game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
⇢ The player reads through a narrative, makes choices, and experience different story outcomes.


• What it does

Our project is an "interactive story game" where players click on choices and follow different story paths. Each decision affects the direction of the story, making every playthrough unique.

• Features
⇢ Interactive branching   story   with   multiple   scenes   and   choices  
⇢ Typewriter-style   text   effect   with   pauses,   colors,   and   sound effects  
⇢ Background   images and slideshows per scene  
⇢ Main  menu   with   Start,  Settings, and  Credits
⇢ Adjustable   volume   with   saved   preferences 

• How we built it

We built the project using:

⇢ HTML → for the structure of the story
⇢ CSS → for styling and design
⇢ JavaScript → for handling choices and interactivity

We also used W3Schools tutorials to learn and apply coding concepts.
